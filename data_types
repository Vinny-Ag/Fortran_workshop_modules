Pogram data_types

Implicit none

!the above statement is required for all FORTRAN programs, it imposes the need for explicit declariation of  all variables

! Datat types: REAL, INTEGER, CHARACTER LOGICAL, COMPLEX 

! REAL = REALNUMBER
! INTEGER = SELF EXPLANATORY
! LOGICALS = TAKE ON TRUE OR FALSE VALUES. BELOW THE STRUCTURE OF A LOGICAL IS DEMONSTRATED. PERIODS ARE REQUIRED ON THE TRUE/FALSE VALUES

LOGICAL :: LOGVAL
LOGVAL = .TRUE.
LOGVAL = .FALSE.

!CHARACTERS = USED FOR CHARACTER ASSIGNMENTS. NEED TO DEFINE MAXIMUM LENGTH AS AN ATTRIBUTE

CHARACTER(LEN=LENGTH)::VAR_1,VAR_2,VAR_3,...,VAR_N
! THE ABOVE EXAMPLE, THE LEN VALUE WILL DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES YOU CAN HAVE IN YOUR LSIT

CHARACTER(LEN=LENGTH)::VAR_1,VAR_2*SOME_LEN,...,VAR_N
! THE ABOVE EXAMPLE THE LENGTH VALUE WILL APPLY TO ALL VARIABLE EXCEPT VAR_2*SOME_LEN WHICH WILL GET THE PRE ASSIGNED VALUE OF SOME_LEN

! FOR CONCATENATION USE //

!INITIALIZATION OF VARIABLE. FORTRAN DOES NOT INITIALIZE VARIABLES AND THUS THEIR VALUE IS ONLY VALID ON CODE AFTER SETTING THE VARIABLE
!YOU CAN EITHER INITIALIZE AT THE TOP OF THE CODE OR 
!YOU CAN USE THE PARAMETER ATTRIBUTE TO SET A VARIABLE THAT IS UNCHAGEABLE FOR THE ENTIRE CODE

REAL, PARAMETER::HALF=0.5

!PARAMETER IS AN ATTRIBUTE OF REAL OR INTEGER, SO IT COMES AFTER EITHER
