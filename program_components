four types of program units

!main program

program prgram_name

end program

!functions
!intrinsic and external
!intrinsic are those built in like sin, cos, absolute_value, etc
!external functions are built by us as an extension to the greater pgrogream 
!compiler companies that claim to support function standards should correctly compile intrinsic functions 
!there can be compilers that "extend" the function of intrinsic functions

!general example
function function_name

end function

!example 2 (only integer part will be retrurned)
intval=int(5.7)
Print *,'intval=', intval
  output: "intval=5"

!example 3
intval = int(real(3)/real(2))
print *,'invalt=', intval
  output:"intval=1"
 
!example 4
intval =-5
if(abs(intval).ge.4) then
  print *,'YES'
else
  print *,'NO'
endif
  output: "YES"

  



!subroutines
!similar to a function but the end result may be to return a number or some task that has no return value.
!subroutines are "called" from some other program unit

!example 1

Subroutine Break(x, whole, frac)
!this breaks a real number (x) into its (whole) and
!fractional (frac) parts

!variable declarations

real:: x,frac
integer::whole

!now the routine

whole = int(x)
frac = x-float(whole)

return
end
