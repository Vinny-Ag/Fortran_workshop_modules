Program Intro_notes

! Keep in mind that all words are case sensitive in fortran
! we start every program with the "program" tag and we can name the prgram after the tag
! all comments begin with an exclamation point
! to print a statement we use the following format:    print *,'this is what will be printed'

! every program must be explicitly ended with End or End program or End program name

End
